## Project Overview
A small database-driven application to manage student course enrollments. The project demonstrates relational database design, normalization, DDL/DML, joins, aggregation, and a minimal command-line interface for interacting with the database. Implemented using SQLite (or MySQL) and a short Python CLI for interaction.

## Features
- Students, Courses, and Enrollments tables with referential integrity.
- SQL scripts to create schema and populate sample data.
- Example queries showing JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions.
- Simple Python CLI (`app.py`) to add/list students, courses, and enrollments.
- All code documented with inline comments.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (if using the CLI)
- SQLite (or MySQL server + connector)
- git (for version control)
